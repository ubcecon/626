# Problem 1

In the linear model, $Y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon$, assume $\mathrm{Var}(X)>0$ and $\Er[\epsilon] = 0$. Show that without any more assumptions, $\beta$ is not identified by finding values of $\beta$ that are observationally equivalent.

# Problem 2

Suppose $Y_i = m(X_i' \beta + u_i)$ for $i=1, ... , n$ with $X_i \in \R^k$
and  $m:\R \to \R$ is a known function. Throughout, assume that observations are independent across $i$, $\Er[u] =0$,
and $u$ is independent of $X$, and $\Er[XX']$ is nonsingular. $Y$ and $X$ are observed, but $u$ is not.

1. If $m$ is strictly increasing show that $\beta$ is identified by explicitly writing $\beta$ as a function of the distribution of $X$ and $Y$.

2. Suppose $m(z) = 1\{z \geq 0\}$. For simplicitly, let $k=1$ and $X_i \in \{-1, 1\}$. Show that $\beta$ is not identified by finding an observationally equivalent $\tilde{\beta}$.

# Problem 3

@song2021 Chatper 4, exercise 1.3.

Consider the binary choice model in Example 1.3 and assume that
$\tilde{\beta}_0$ and $\tilde{\beta}_1$ have appropriate estimators
$\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$. Provide a sample analogue
estimator of the average derivative, replacing $\tilde{\beta}_0$ and
$\tilde{\beta}_1$ with $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$
