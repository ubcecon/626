# Problem 1

In "Marijuana legalization and traffic fatalities revisited", @chen2023 analyze how marijuana legalization in the US affected traffic fatalities.

## TWFE

@chen2023 begin by estimating a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model,
$$
F_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 MM_{it} + \beta_2 RM_{it} + X_{it}\gamma + \eta_i + \theta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
where $F_{it}$ is log traffic fatalaties per 100,000 in state $i$ and year $t$, $MM_{it}$ is an indicator for medical marijuana being legal, $RM_{it}$ is an indicator for legalized recreational marijuana, and $X_{it}$ are state covariates including traffic volume, economic conditions, and demographics. @chen2023 present estimates of the TWFE model "for comparison with the literature," but also compute other estimators. Why? What is a problem with TWFE here?

## Multiple Treatments

Suppose $1/2$ of states legalized medical marijuana in a single year and no other changes occurred in $MM_{it}$. Also suppose $1/4$ of states legalized recretaional marijuana in a single later year and no other changes occurred in $RM_{it}$. That is, there is no variation in treatment timing, but there are multiple treatments. For simplicity, ignore covariates. Would estimating a TWFE model,
$$
F_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 MM_{it} + \beta_2 RM_{it} + \eta_i + \theta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
recover an interpretable average treatment effect on the treated?

## $DID_M$, $DID_\ell$

@chen2023 also report the $DID_M$ and $DID_\ell$ estimators? What are these? What sort of average treatment effect do they estimate? (You will need to read @chen2023 and perhaps also @dd2020 to answer this.)

## Results

Table 2 and Figure 1 show the main results of the paper. What conclusions would you draw from these?

# Problem 2

Consider the following linear regression model such that
$$
Y_i = β_0 + X_i β_1 + u_i ,
$$
where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are observed random variables. Let us assume that
$\Er [u_i ] = 0$ but $\cov(X_i , u_i ) \neq 0$.
Suppose that there exists a variable $Z_i$ such that
$\cov(X_i , Z_i ) > 0$ and
$\cov(Z_i , u_i ) > 0$.

Find the asymptotic bias of the 2SLS estimator of
$\hat{\beta}_1$. (Recall that the asymptotic bias of an estimator is
its probability limit minus the true parameter.) Can you determine
unambiguously whether the 2SLS estimator tends to underestimate or
overestimate the parameter $β_1$ ? If so, give explanations how.
