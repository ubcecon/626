### UBC values and policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain
healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so
there are additional resources to access including those for survivors
of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all
members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are
not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides
appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for
religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and
students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and
to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their
actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are
available here
