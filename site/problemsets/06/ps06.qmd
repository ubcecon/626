# Problem 1

In the linear model,
$$
y = \underbrace{X}_{n \times k} \beta + \epsilon,
$$
partition $X$ as
$$
X= \begin{pmatrix}
     \underbrace{X_1}_{n \times k_1} &
     \underbrace{ X_2}_{n \times (k - k_1)}
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

and $\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_1\\ \beta_2 \end{pmatrix}$.

Let $\hat{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\beta}_1\\ \hat{\beta}_2 \end{pmatrix}$ be the OLS estimator.

Show that
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 =  \textrm{arg}\min_{b_1} \norm{M_{X_2} y - M_{X_2} X_1 b_1 }^2
$$
where $M_{X_2} = I - X_2 (X_2' X_2)^{-1} X_2'$.

# Problem 2

Consider estimating the linear model,^[This problem is partially based on @borusyak2018.]
$$
y_i = \beta D_i + x_i' \alpha + \epsilon_i
$$
where $\beta \in \R$, $D_i \in \{0,1\}$ and $x_i \in \R^k$.


1. Show that the OLS estimate for $\beta$ can be written as
$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \hat{\omega}(x_i,D_i)
$$
where $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n D_i \hat{\omega}(x_i,D_i) = 1$, and $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (1-D_i) \hat{\omega}(x_i,D_i) = -1$. [Hint: use the result of problem 2.]

2. Let
$$
\pi \in \mathrm{arg}\min_{\pi} \Er[(D_i - x_i'\pi)^2].
$$
Show that
$$
\hat{\omega}(x,D) \inprob \frac{D - x'\pi}{\Er[(D - x'\pi)^2]}
$$
If needed, state additional assumptions about dependence or moments.

3. Suppose that the linear model being estimated might not be the data
generating process. Instead, assume the data comes from a potential
outcomes framework. There are potential outcomes
$(y_i(1),y_i(0))$. You observe $y_i = y_i(1)D_i + y_i(0)(1-D_i)$.
Show that
$$
\hat{\beta} \inprob \Er[y_i(0) \omega(x_i,D_i)] + \Er\left[\left(y_i(1) - y_i(0)\right) D_i \omega(x_i,D_i) \right].
$$

4. If you assume that $(y_i(1),y_i(0))$ are independent of $D_i$ conditional on $x_i$, does $\hat{\beta}$ have any nice interpretation?
[Hint: what can be the range of $\omega(x,1)$, especially if the range of $x$ is large?]

# Problem 3

In "Marijuana legalization and traffic fatalities revisited", @chen2023 analyze how marijuana legalization in the US affected traffic fatalities.

## TWFE

@chen2023 begin by estimating a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model,
$$
F_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 MM_{it} + \beta_2 RM_{it} + X_{it}\gamma + \eta_i + \theta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
where $F_{it}$ is log traffic fatalaties per 100,000 in state $i$ and year $t$, $MM_{it}$ is an indicator for medical marijuana being legal, $RM_{it}$ is an indicator for legalized recreational marijuana, and $X_{it}$ are state covariates including traffic volume, economic conditions, and demographics. @chen2023 present estimates of the TWFE model "for comparison with the literature," but also compute other estimators. Why? What is a problem with TWFE here?

## Multiple Treatments

Suppose $1/2$ of states legalized medical marijuana in a single year and no other changes occurred in $MM_{it}$. Also suppose $1/4$ of states legalized recretaional marijuana in a single later year and no other changes occurred in $RM_{it}$. That is, there is no variation in treatment timing, but there are multiple treatments. For simplicity, ignore covariates. Would estimating a TWFE model,
$$
F_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 MM_{it} + \beta_2 RM_{it} + \eta_i + \theta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
recover an interpretable average treatment effect on the treated? Your answer should include some algebra or perhaps computer computations relating $\hat{\beta}_1$ and/or $\hat{\beta}_2$ to potential outcomes. Feel free to make reasonable additional assumptions to help simplify the analysis.

## $DID_M$, $DID_\ell$

@chen2023 also report the $DID_M$ and $DID_\ell$ estimators? What are these? What sort of average treatment effect do they estimate? (You will need to read @chen2023 and perhaps also @dd2020 to answer this.)

## Results

Table 2 and Figure 1 show the main results of the paper. What conclusions would you draw from these?
