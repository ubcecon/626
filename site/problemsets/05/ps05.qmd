# Problem 1

Suppose $X_n = O_p(a_n)$ and $Y_n - c = O_p(a_n)$ for $c \neq 0$
and $a_n \to 0$. Show that $\frac{X_n}{Y_n} = O_p(a_n)$.

*Hint: $\frac{X_n}{Y_n} = \frac{X_n}{c} + \frac{X_n}{Y_n} (c - Y_n) \frac{1}{c}$, use Lemma 3.3 and Exericse 3.1 from @song2021.*

# Problem 2

Suppose that each individual person $i$ has potential outcomes $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ depending on the treated state or the untreated state. The average treatment effect is defined to be
$$
	\tau = \Er[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)].
$$
We assume that the econometrician observes $(Y_i,D_i)$, where $Y_i = D_i Y_i(1) + (1 - D_i)Y_i(0)$, $D_i$ is a binary variable representing the treatment status, and that $(Y_(1),Y_i(0))$ is independent of $D_i$. Finally, assume that $0 < \Er[D_i] <1$, $Y_i \in [0,1]$ for all $i =1,...,n$, and that $(Y_i(1),Y_i(0),D_i)$ are i.i.d. across $i$'s.

1. Show that
$$
\hat{\tau} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i D_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n D_i} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i (1-D_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n (1-D_i)}
$$
is a consistent estimator for $\tau$.

2. Show that $\hat{\tau} - \tau = O_p(n^{-1/2})$

3. Show that $\sqrt{n}(\hat{\tau}-\tau) \to^d N(0,\sigma_\tau^2)$ and calculate $\sigma_\tau^2$.

<!-- # Problem 3 -->

<!-- Again, suppose that each individual person $i$ has potential outcomes $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ and treatment $T_i$. Suppose that for $t \in \{0,1\}$ -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y_i(t) = X_i'\beta_t + u_i(t) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Assume that observations are i.i.d. with $T_i \indep (X_i, u_i(1), u_(0))$ and $\Er[u_i(t)|X_i]=0$. Also assume that $\Er[u(t)u(t)'] = \sigma_t^2 I_n$. In parts 2 and 3, assume that $X_i' = (1, W_i')$ with $\Er[W_i] = 0$. -->

<!-- 1. Show that in the linear model  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 T_i + \epsilon_i, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- the OLS estimate $\hat{\alpha}_1$ is a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect. -->

<!-- 2. Show that in the additive linear model  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y_i = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 T_i + W_i'\gamma_2 + \nu_i -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- the OLS estimate $\hat{\gamma}_1$ is a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect. -->

<!-- 3. Show that in the interactive linear model -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 T_i + W_i'\delta_2 + T_i W_i' \delta_3 + \eta_i -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- the OLS estimate of $\hat{\delta}_1$ is a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect. -->
