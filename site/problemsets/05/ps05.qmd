# Problem 1

Suppose $X_n = O_p(a_n)$ and $Y_n - c = O_p(a_n)$ for $c \neq 0$
and $a_n \to 0$. Show that $\frac{X_n}{Y_n} = O_p(a_n)$.

*Hint: $\frac{X_n}{Y_n} = \frac{X_n}{c} + \frac{X_n}{Y_n} (c - Y_n) \frac{1}{c}$, use Lemma 3.3 and Exericse 3.1 from @song2021.*

# Problem 2

Suppose that each individual person $i$ has potential outcomes $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ depending on the treated state or the untreated state. The average treatment effect is defined to be
$$
	\tau = \Er[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)].
$$
We assume that the econometrician observes $(Y_i,D_i)$, where $Y_i = D_i Y_i(1) + (1 - D_i)Y_i(0)$, $D_i$ is a binary variable representing the treatment status, and that $(Y_(1),Y_i(0))$ is independent of $D_i$. Finally, assume that $0 < \Er[D_i] <1$, $Y_i \in [0,1]$ for all $i =1,...,n$, and that $(Y_i(1),Y_i(0),D_i)$ are i.i.d. across $i$'s.

1. Show that
$$
\hat{\tau} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i D_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n D_i} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i (1-D_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n (1-D_i)}
$$
is a consistent estimator for $\tau$.

2. Show that $\hat{\tau} - \tau = O_p(n^{-1/2})$

3. Show that $\sqrt{n}(\hat{\tau}-\tau) \to^d N(0,\sigma_\tau^2)$ and calculate $\sigma_\tau^2$.

<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Y_i = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 T_i + W_i'\gamma_2 + \nu_i -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- the OLS estimate $\hat{\gamma}_1$ is a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect. -->

<!-- 3. Show that in the interactive linear model -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 T_i + W_i'\delta_2 + T_i W_i' \delta_3 + \eta_i -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- the OLS estimate of $\hat{\delta}_1$ is a consistent estimate of the average treatment effect. -->

# Problem 3

Consider the simple regression model
$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^*_i + \epsilon_i
$$
Assume that $\var(x^*)>0$ and $\Er[x^* \epsilon] = 0$.
However, $x^*$ is measured with error. Instead of observing
$x^*$, you observe $x_i = x^*_i + u_i$. Assume that $\Er[u] = 0$,
$\Er[u x^*] =0$ and $\Er[\epsilon u] = 0$.

## 1

Find $\plim \hat{\beta}_1$, where $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the OLS etimator.

## 2

In ``Do Low Levels of Blood Lead Reduce
Children's Future Test Scores?'' @aizer2018 examine the
relationship between blood lead levels and children's test
scores. Table 4 shows estimates of $\beta_1$ from regressions of

$$
test_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 lead_i + \text{ other controls} + \epsilon_i
$$ {#eq-lead}

where $test_i$ is a 3rd grade reading or math test and $lead_i$ is a
blood lead level measurement taken before the age of six. Some
children had multiple measurements of their blood lead levels
taken. Each blood lead level measurement has some error. In comparing
columns (1) and (2), note that venous tests are known to have less
measurement error than capillary tests, and in comparing columns (3)
and (4) the average of all blood lead levels has less measurement
error than a single one. Are the changes in the estimates across
columns what you would expect from part part 1? Why or why not?

## 3

Suppose $z_i$ is a second measurement of $x^*$,
\[ z_i = x^*_i + e_i \]
with $\Er[e] = 0$, $\Er[x^* e] = 0$, $\Er[\epsilon e] = 0$ and
$\Er[e u] = 0$. Show that
$$
\hat{\beta}_1^{IV} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \bar{z}) y_i} {\sum_{i=1}^n
   (z_i - \bar{z}) x_i}
$$
is a consistent estimate of $\beta_1$.

## 4

Table 5 from @aizer2018, shows additional estimates of
the model @eq-lead. Column (1) shows
standard multiple regression estimates. Columns (2) and (3) show
estimates using the estimator $\hat{\beta}_1^{IV}$ from part
3. Is the change in the estimates between columns (1) and
(2) what you would expect based on parts 1 and 3?
Why or why not?
