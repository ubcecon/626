The study of identification has been clearly linked to the design of experiments. In a well-designed experiment the treatment group and the control group are similar in every aspect, except for the treatment. The difference in response may therefore be attributed to the treatment and the parameters of interest are identified. An extensive study of the identifiability conditions for the simultaneous equations models under various assumptions about the underlying structures was provided by Fisher. This chapter discusses the development of the subject since the publication of Fisher's book. It discusses the basic concepts of identification and some identifiability criteria for contemporaneous–simultaneous equation models under linear constraints. The chapter discusses criteria for models subject to nonlinear continuous differentiable constraints and covariance restrictions with special emphasis on the applications to errors in variables and variance components models. The Bayesian view on identification is also discussed in the chapter.}

abstract = {When one wants to estimate a model without specifying the functions and distributions parametrically, or when one wants to analyze the identification of a model independently of any particular parametric specification, it is useful to perform a nonparametric analysis of identification. This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.}

abstract = {This chapter reviews the microeconometrics literature on partial identification, focusing on the developments of the last thirty years. The topics presented illustrate that the available data combined with credible maintained assumptions may yield much information about a parameter of interest, even if they do not reveal it exactly. Special attention is devoted to discussing the challenges associated with, and some of the solutions put forward to, (1) obtain a tractable characterization of the values for the parameters of interest which are observationally equivalent, given the available data and maintained assumptions; (2) estimate this set of values; (3) conduct test of hypotheses and make confidence statements. The chapter reviews advances in partial identification analysis both as applied to learning (functionals of) probability distributions that are well-defined in the absence of models, as well as to learning parameters that are well-defined only in the context of particular models. A simple organizing principle is highlighted: the source of the identification problem can often be traced to a collection of random variables that are consistent with the available data and maintained assumptions. This collection may be part of the observed data or be a model implication. In either case, it can be formalized as a random set. Random set theory is then used as a mathematical framework to unify a number of special results and produce a general methodology to carry out partial identification analysis.}

Instead, it is based on convolution with a small (scalar) Gaussian distribution as well as on basic facts about weak convergence and measure theory. Moreover, we show how, by similar means, one may prove the fact that a distribution with integrable characteristic function is absolutely continuous with respect to d-dimensional Lebesgue measure and derive the formula for its density.}

We tabulate critical values that enable using the first-stage F-statistic (or, when there are multiple endogenous regressors, the Cragg-Donald (1993) statistic) to test whether given instruments are weak. A technical contribution is to justify sequential asymptotic approximations for IV statistics with many weak instruments.},

abstract="Generalized method of moments (GMM) refers to a class of estimators constructed from the sample moment counterparts of population moment conditions (sometimes known as orthogonality conditions) of the data generating model. GMM estimators have become widely used, for the following reasons:1.GMM estimators have large sample properties that are easy to characterize. A family of such estimators can be studied simultaneously in ways that make asymptotic efficiency comparisons easy. The method also provides a natural way to construct tests which take account of both sampling and estimation error.2.In practice, researchers find it useful that GMM estimators may be constructed without specifying the full data generating process (which would be required to write down the maximum likelihood estimator). This characteristic has been exploited in analysing partially specified economic models, studying potentially misspecified dynamic models designed to match target moments, and constructing stochastic discount factor models that link asset pricing to sources of macroeconomic risk.",
